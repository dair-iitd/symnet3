Code for SymNet3.0: Exploiting Long-Range Influences in Learning Generalized Neural Policies for Relational MDPs, UAI 2023([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sWzgZUmJich))



Please download datasets and instances from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWj65dVnTlRmj5iKcdFCC_7Lbf19jPhV/view?usp=sharing) into the main folder and unzip it.




## Libraries required

1. python3
2. tensorflow=2.0
3. unittest
4. multiprocessing
5. threading
6. shutil
7. better_exceptions
8. pickle
9. networkx
10. scipy
11. tqdm
12. pandas
13. numpy


## Running an experiment

To run an experiment, set parameters in my_config.py. The important ones are the 'domain', 'mode', 'model_dir' and 'setting'. To train a model, just run:

```
python train.py
```

This file both trains and validates models. The best model is stored in the checkpoints/ subfolder of the model folder. The meta_logging.csv file shows reward progress across training.

To run inference on the best model, just run:

```
python test.py
```

This will generate a file results.csv in the model folder which will contain rewards obtained by the best model. 

## Important parameters explained

Parameters can be set in two files in multi_train/deep_plan:

1. my_config.py
2. symnet3_config.py

The most important parameters are:

1. mode: This sets the training setting and architecture. Use "no_dist" for SymNet2.0, "kl" for SymNet3.0+KL, "no_kl" for SymNet3.0-KL and "kl_decay" for SymNet3+KL_{decay}
2. setting: This sets the instances to be used for training. "lr" uses the Long Range instances and "ippc" uses the IPPC instances. The instances used for training are given in train.py. 
## Code Organization

1. data/ contains trajectory data generated by PROST and the generators used for instance generation.
2. gym/ contains code for initializing and simulating RDDL environments.
3. rddl/ contains all the instance files along with their DBN .dot files and parsed files.
4. utils/ contains code for extracting. instance graph and generating other utilities for all the environments.
5. spektral/ contains code used for GATs and the Influence Layer.
6. multi_train/ contains code for training and evaluation.
7. multi_train/deep_plan/networks contains code for the architecture.
